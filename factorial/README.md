# Factorial #

This section contains three ways of factorial calculation.

Factorial from number `N` means product of multiplication of all elements `N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1`.
So for `N = 5` it would be `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

- Simple iteration method.
- Simple recursion.
- Recursion with tail-end optimization.
