# Fibonacci sequence #

This section contains three ways of Fibonacci sequence calculation.

Fibonacci sequence is integer sequence in which every number
after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
```
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2);
```

- Simple iteration method.
- Simple recursion.
- Rounding.
